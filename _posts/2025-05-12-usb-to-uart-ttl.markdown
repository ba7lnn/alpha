The TTL 232R 5V/3V3 is a USB to Serial (TTL level) converter cable which allows for a simple way to connect TTL interface units to USB. This version of CH340's USB to TTL serial adapter cables has it's I/O pins configured to operate at 5V or 3.3V levels.

The TTL RS232 5V/3V3 uses a CH340 IC which is housed inside the USB "A" connector, and is terminated at the end of a 1 meter cable with a 0.1" pitch header socket which provided access to transmit (Tx), receive (Rx), These lines all operate at 5V/3.3V levels. Also brought out on the header are Vcc (5V), and GND.

The TTL RS232 5V/3V3 is fully RoHS compliant and is supplied loose - packed in an anti-static bag. ZIP-lock packing.
